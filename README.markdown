# Marvin

Marvin is a Padrino-, MongoMapper-, and Haml-powered tumblelog engine.

**Disclaimer:** This project is very, very, _very_ immature. It is not even complete yet. Don't even think about using it in production. To see what Marvin will be, [check out the roadmap](https://github.com/eturk/marvin/wiki/Roadmap).
